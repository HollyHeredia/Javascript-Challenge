# Javascript-Challenge
JavaScript homework challenge for bootcamp.

In this excercise the mission was to load a table using JavaScript and HTML and add a filter to the webpage. To do this I:

* Used the starter HTML provided to create a base for the webpage.

* Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Made sure my columns match the items in the data file provided.

* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
